<h2>Description:</h2>
<br>
Word converter is able to transform numbers into a combination of words; using a T9 or Phonewords style. 
For example: â€˜23â€™ user input will have as an output: <strong> ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf.</strong>
<br>
As 0 and 1 does not have any values (letters) if the user inserts these numbers it will just ignore them (return an empty string).
